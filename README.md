### Hi there 👋

Let's quickly introduce myself to you ! My name is Alexandre Fayolle and I've been into science and geek stuff since I was a kid. 🧒

It took me a bit of time to realize it, but after devoting myself to study sciences and maths. I made the choice to completely retrain in order to fulfill a childhood dream of becoming a developer. 💻

I'm always starving for new discoveries and that's one thing i love in this space. 👨‍🚀

Hope to see you soon ! 🤝
